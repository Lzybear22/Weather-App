# Overview

This is a weather applictaion. It takes all the information provided by openweather API and lets users see the temp, humidity, and forecast of the city they entered in. 

I want to be a better front end developer and learn how to make more complex websites and web pages. I have made a few static websites but JavaScript makes websites way more fun to make and use.

# Development Environment

The tools used in this program are VSCode for writing code and file orginization. Live sever to run the project and test the program locally. Git for version control. OpenWeather API to retrive the weather data. 

I used JavaScript to show the city users typed in. HTML to start and build the website. CSS to make changes to the colors, fonts, and layout of the website. 

# Useful Websites

- All the websites and links in my WDD 130 class 
- OpenWeather API https://openweathermap.org/
- JavaScript Tutorial https://javascript.info/

# Future Work

- Making the app look better. Adding some pictures in the backround of the display to showcase if it is night or day. Raining or cloudy.
- Showcasing the time in the display. Adding a sun and moon to show it is night or day.
- Adding in weekly forecasts for cities. I would have to use coordinates to make sure the weekly forecast is showcasing the correct location.
